          Titan Vision’s dad is a music producer, and he grew up listening to
          him and his older siblings creating music together. His dad would
          produce the songs, and his siblings would help write the lyrics and
          sing over his melodies. As soon as he was able to talk, singing began
          the start of his musical journey as well. The songs that his family
          sang together bore life lessons derived from experience with themes of
          kindness, integrity, and courage. For Titan, music is more than sound;
          it’s the language of his culture, a vibrant symphony weaving together
          history, identity, and shared experiences.

          His father and mother were born and raised in New York City. Unbound
          by specific traditions, they found harmony in the diverse cultures of
          New York through music. This appreciation became his culture, and what
          they passed on to him as he grew up. He was raised by the music of New
          York. The morning hip hop in the parks of New York and the jazz music
          playing at various jazz clubs and open mics were opportunities for him
          to listen, be inspired, and grow.
          <br />
          <br />
          Music has allowed him to understand and appreciate other people's
          cultures and traditions as a form of expression. In the All City High
          School Latin Ensemble, he learned various Spanish phrases and songs,
          discovering how people immigrated to New York from places like Puerto
          Rico in search of opportunity. These common themes in Afro-Cuban music
          deepened his understanding of Latin culture and appreciation of their
          history. While playing in his high school’s Black History Month
          showcase, they discussed how the hymns originated from the experiences
          of African Americans during the slave trade and were a source of
          strength, community, and inspiration.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each style that he has pursued and learned about musically has brought
          with it entrancing qualities: classical harmonies taught balance and
          restraint, while jazz improvisation offered limitless freedom of
          expression, and Latin rhythms taught precision. Over time, music has
          become his language for emotions that transcend words: love, loss,
          compassion, and joy. This rudimentary language has shaped his
          character and become his vehicle for connection and growth.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a defining aspect of his connection to his heritage, he cannot
          imagine himself without music. As he grows, he hopes to thrive and
          share music with the world, continuing to connect with others and
          share experiences across differences.
